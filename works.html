		<h3>A Spectral Crime</h3>
		<p>A "choose your own adventure" game made with HTML and CSS. With multiple story paths and three possible
			endings, A Spectral Crime demonstrates my experience with managing branching interactive narratives.
		<div style="text-align:center; font-size: 26px;"><a href="NarProj/index.html">Check it out

		<h3>Cindercrown</h3>
		<p>A 60+ page narrative document for an RPG world created as part of UCF's Writing for Video Games course.
			Outlines three unique factions, a multi-ending story, characters with complex backstories and motivations,
			hypothetical gameplay mechanics, and a sample mission sequence. Artifical intelligence was used for concept
			art, all textual content is my own work with no AI assistance.</p>

		<h3>Law of The Dragon</h3>
		<p>A 30 page fantasy comedy script for a short film. The script follows Hyrothadax, a dragon who must fight to
			retrieve his stolen hoard in the court of law. With a focus on comedy and worldbuilding, Law of The Dragon
			is an excellent example of my experience developing realistic dialogue and compelling characters.</p>
