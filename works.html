		<h3>Cindercrown</h3>
		<p>A 60+ page narrative document for an RPG world created as part of UCF's Writing for Video Games course.
			Outlines three unique factions, a multi-ending story, characters with complex backstories and motivations,
			hypothetical gameplay mechanics, and a sample mission sequence. Artifical intelligence was used for concept
			art, all textual content is my own work with no AI assistance.</p>

		<h3>A Spectral Crime</h3>
		<p>A "choose your own adventure" game made with HTML and CSS. With multiple story paths and three possible
			endings, <i>A Spectral Crime</i> demonstrates my experience with managing branching interactive narratives.

		<h3>Law of The Dragon</h3>
		<p>A 30 page fantasy comedy script for a short film. The script follows Hyrothadax, a dragon who must fight to
			retrieve his stolen hoard in the court of law. With a focus on comedy and worldbuilding, <i>Law of The Dragon</i>
			is an excellent example of my experience developing realistic dialogue and compelling characters.</p>

		<h3>Excerpt from The Arus Machina</h3>
		<p>A ~1400 word excerpt from a fictitious religious text created for a group worldbuilding project. Together with 3 of my peers, we each developed in-universe documents which served as background information for a collaboratively developed world, <i>Vides</i>. <i>The Arus Machina</i> excerpt was my contribution to this project. Focused on emulating modern religious texts, this document serves as a “hook”, meant to generate interest in readers about the history and religions of the world of <i>Vides</i>.</p>
