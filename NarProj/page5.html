                <p>Following the red stains, which with every passing second you are increasingly sure are blood, you kick over the living room rug and discover a hole carved into the wooden floors. Within lies the body of Charles Clockworth, rigid, pale, and decidedly lifeless. Though he doesn’t look half bad for a dead man. His grey beard gives him a stoic, sage-like look, and he’s dressed in a fine suit like the president was about to visit before his untimely demise.</p>
<p>You consider your comment to the rookie outside earlier… clearly the M.I.D. doesn’t hire the best if they missed this. I mean, the body was right there! You mentally file your complaint away, intending to take it back to the NYPD chief, but right now that can wait, you’ve got a corpse on your hands.</p>
<p>You kneel down next to the corpse, recalling your extensive education in the art of Magick. You know of two occult rituals that could help you find the killer. Knowing that a ghost was likely responsible (as your P.D. still won't stop beeping), you could <a href="page8.html">divine traces of the paranormal</a>. You also know a bit of necromantic Magick and believe that the body is fresh enough to <a href="page6.html">view its recent memories</a>. Either approach would work in theory, but you don’t know which would be the most effective off the top of your head…</p>
