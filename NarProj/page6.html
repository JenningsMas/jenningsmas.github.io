                <p>You decide to take a quick plunge into Mr. Clockworth’s memories. After all, there's no better eyewitness account of the murder than a memory from the victim himself.</p>
<p>You place your hands over the body’s eyes and speak an incantation in a long-forgotten tongue, a practiced ritual you picked up from a necromancer you knew back in ‘99. Great guy. Well, until the incident in the morgue, but discounting that, great guy.</p>
<p>As soon as you finish the incantation, an overwhelming sense of dread envelops you, your sense of identity shatters, and with a gut-wrenching spiritual lurch, you SEE.</p>

<div>
<p>Your name is Charles Clockworth. You’re about to settle into bed after a long, long day of running your business. It still amazes you how much people are willing to pay to rewrite the past, especially people who want something hidden. As you pull the covers over yourself, you contemplate how you’ll spend the extra million dollars you made today from undoing the outcome of a politician’s murder case. The foyer could use some new grandfather clocks…</p>
<p>Suddenly, you hear a horrific scream. Your eyes dart to the door to your bedroom, and you see something you had hoped to never see in your life. A ghost. A ghost you recognize.</p>
<p>The spirit looked as if it had been painted onto the world, a smattering of black and white in the shape of a man, except it lacked any detail. Like a child’s nightmare come to life. Your heart rate shoots through the roof as it raises its arm to point and speaks a single word with a voice that sounds like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p>“YOU.”</p>
<p>You know this ghost. You know this ghost too well.</p>
<p>Your immediate reaction is to fall to your knees and beg. You had to kill him! It was the only way to guarantee the client’s safety! If you left the man alive, your client would never have walked away from trial without a life sentence, in life, the ghost’s testimony was too valuable to the prosecution's push for a first-degree murder charge! It was only business, surely the ghost would understand!</p>
<p>Your pleas fall on deaf ears. The ghost lurches forward and spears its spectral hand through your heart.</p>
<p>It is cold, so so cold…</p>
<p>As a golden light you recognize seems to envelop your very spirit, your own time magick primed to shoot your soul into the distant past, you wish you used your magick for something other than money…</p>
</div>

<p>You wake from the vision in a cold sweat and have to take a moment to remind yourself who you are. You’re a detective, a Thaumaturgical Investigator, not some eccentric clock-based time wizard. That memory felt so real…</p>
<p>As you ponder the memory, you hold the image of the ghost in mind. With a solid visualization, you could <a href="page8.html">track it down</a>, it likely hasn’t left the house yet.</p>
<p>But… that memory… clearly Clockworth wasn’t… the best person. Using such a rare magick as time magick to cover up a murder… <a href="page7.html">perhaps it's better to let this one go...</a>.</p>
