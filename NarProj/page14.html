               <p>You lay out the occult supplies in their designated positions and begin a magickal chant. The light in the room flickers, then dies as the magick takes hold. Rather anticlimactically, while you’re in the middle of your chant, a ghost appears at the center of the ritual circle.</p>
<p>It’s a grey-black impression of a person, a half-formed spirit that looks like it was formed rather recently. It stares at you with vacant, pure-white eyes, then floats off into a nearby hallway, gesturing for you to follow.</p>
<p>As you stand to follow the ghost into the hall, it speaks.</p>
<p>“Why… have you… come…” its voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard, and your skin crawls with dread with every enunciated word.</p>
<p>“I’m here for the killer of Charles Clockworth,” you answer honestly (you’ve learned it’s best not to lie to unknown ghosts), and the ghost stops. It turns to face you, staring you down.</p>
<p>“You… have… him… then…” the ghost gestures to itself. “But… you… should… hear… me… out… first…”</p>
<p>“Start talking.” You take a stance, ready to fight at any moment, but you let the ghost continue. You have a confession, but your curiosity is peaked.</p>
<p>“He… killed… me… first…” The ghost floats closer. “Covered… up… his own… crime… so… I… took… revenge…”</p>
<p>“And I’m supposed to believe that?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The ghost continues to stare. “Leave… this… place… look… for… his… clients.”</p>
<p>“Why would I?”</p>
<p>“There… are… bigger… fish… to… fry. This… conspiracy… runs… deep. Across… the… city… and… across… time.”</p>
<p>You could <a href="page7.html">take the ghost at his word</a>, the mention of a conspiracy has certainly piqued your interest, but it just admitted to murder. Protocol says you should arrest it immediately, and you know <a href="page11.html">just the spell that could help</a>.</p>
