               <p>You’re on the trail now. Your Paranormal Detector is blaring, and with a clear visualization of the ghost’s traces in your mind, you can easily track it down, and track it down you do.</p>
                <p>You run through the halls of the mansion, chasing faint signatures that register in your magickaly adept mind, when you finally find the ghost floating through the halls.</p>
                <p>The spirit looks like a grey-black charcoal drawing of a man made by a kindergartener.</p>
                <p>Clearly it came into being recently, more advanced ghosts look much more… real, than this.</p>
                <p>Advanced or not, a ghost is still deadly. You stand across the hall from it, and take a fighting stance. It, however, turns and begins to fly away!</p>
                <p>Your instincts kick into gear. You could <a href="page9.html">chase the ghost</a>, but that carries some measure of risk, you have no clue what magickal powers it could possess. Or, you could <a href="page11.html">take a magickal approach...</a></p>
