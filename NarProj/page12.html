                    <p>You cast another spell, a more intricate barrier this time, and to your amazement you have enough time to complete the magick before the ghost reaches you.</p>
<p>With an otherworldly wail, the ghost is encased in a blinding white wall of light. As it fights against the barrier, the wall shrinks and shrinks until it’s the size of a basketball. You pant as you watch the orb become completely opaque, a magical barrier strong enough to contain even the most fearsome of ghosts. No way this one’s getting out.</p>
<p>A light rain begins to fall as you exit the building, sealed ghost in hand. The Mundane investigator from earlier is waiting outside, and you toss the ball to him.</p>
<p>“Take this suspect down to booking for me, I need a drink.”</p>
<p>The investigator struggles with his words and goes from holding the ball with confusion to subtle terror as he processes what you just said. You don’t stick around for his myriad of questions, after all, you’ve got other mysteries to solve.</p>
<p>One suspect arrested, countless more to go. Justice may have been served here, but around New York, countless other paranormal crimes need investigating.</p>
<p>With your skills, you believe you can solve them all.</p>
