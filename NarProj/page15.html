               <p>You enter the  bedroom and are greeted by yet more clocks. The room is smaller than you thought it would be, being in a mansion and all that, but that might just be because of the sheer volume of clocks lining the walls. The ticking is deafening, and you wonder how any sane man could sleep with all this noise.</p>
<p>You get to searching, trying your best to block out the noise. Nothing stands out to be obviously paranormal, but you do see some mundane strangeness. The bookshelf on the far wall has a <a href="page16.html">book jutting out at an odd angle</a>, and on closer inspection of the carpeted floor, a series of red stains leads <a href="page5.html">out the door, towards the living room</a>.</p>
