                Jennings Mas is a student at the University of Central Florida in his Senior year studying Creative
                Writing with a minor in Digital Media.
                He currently lives in Orlando, Florida, though this will change with each passing year as the seals
                binding him to the physical realm fade with time.
            </p>

                From a young age, Jennings knew he wanted to be a storyteller. What form those stories took didn't
                matter, as long as he was able to develop the skills and experiences needed to tell them, he would do
                whatever it took.
                Throughout the years, it became clear that the form his stories worked the best in were short stories
                and novels. After experimenting with a business major in his early years in college, Jennings decided to
                commit to fulfiling his lifelong dream of being an author and began his major in Creative Writing.
                Additionally, he made a somewhat last minute decision to pursue a Digital Media minor to expand his
                creative horizons and find new mediums in which his stories could be told.
            </p>
            <p>
                He enjoys writing mystery, fantasy, horror, and science fiction stories as well as honing his web design
                and coding skills. When he is not sealed within the realm of infinite shadow, Jennings enjoys playing
                Tabletop Roleplaying Games, web development, and writing novels.
                Currently, he is enrolled in an Interactive Design class. With the knowledge he gains there, he hopes to
                design interactive experiences that can deeply impact people's lives.
