                <p>You decide that the ghost’s traces can wait. Perhaps these cabinets contain some evidence as to the motive of the killer. Maybe Clockworth was getting up to no good, and he kept records of illicit activity here? Or maybe it is just tax records. Either way, a quick peek wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>What started as a “quick peak” quickly turns into a mad search through the cabinets. With each file you read, you realize more and more that your first guess was right, these are records of illicit activity! One file contains information about the wife of a CEO who was suing for parental rights after a public, and very messy divorce, and alterations to time made by Clockworth to prevent the case from ever going to trial. Another contains evidence of a horrific factory accident resulting in a company paying millions in damages to injured employees after a lengthy lawsuit, and more alterations to the past to ensure that the suit never made it to trial in the first place… the last file you read is of a local politician being arrested for murder due to the critical testimony of an eyewitness, and… a list of alterations to the past that resulted in that witnesses murder… by Clockworth himself!</p>
<p>Shock grips your heart, every single one of these files implicates someone in a grand conspiracy to alter time and cover up crimes. You grab one of the files, the one concerning the politician, and take it out of the room with you. The chief of police needs to see this…</p>
<p>As soon as you leave the secret room, a golden light envelops you. You brace yourself, recognizing a magical attack when you see one, but the golden light quickly fades, leaving you unharmed. But when you look down to examine yourself for injury, you notice that the file is gone!</p>
<p>You curse under your breath, turning around to see that the secret room is now empty. Clockworth must have set up a failsafe to destroy the files in case something happened to him!</p>
<p>You know you can't let this go. Clockworth’s murder can wait, you need to <a href="page7.html">leave and investigate this conspiracy</a>. But… without those files, getting anyone to take this seriously would be next to impossible. A time traveling cover up artist who made it so alleged crimes never happened… That's impossible to prove! By the crimes very nature, it leaves behind no evidence! You’d be better off <a href="page8.html">investigating those paranormal traces you detected earlier</a>. You could at least bring one criminal to justice that way…</p>
