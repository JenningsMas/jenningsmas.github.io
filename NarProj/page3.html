                <p>Charles Clockworth was clearly a man who never knew what the word “subtle” meant. The old Chronomancer took pride in his unique Time Magick, and that was clear in the foyer of his home. Clocks both new and old filled the room, and the ticking was almost deafening. You wonder how the man tolerated the noise, but you’ve seen eccentricity give people the power to tolerate pretty much anything before.</p>

<p>On your toolbelt, your Paranormal Detector beeps wildly. The tool is pretty much just a smartphone enchanted with enough divination Magicks that it could sense even the ghost of a flea if it was tuned the right way. It’s served you well in previous cases, so you’ve made it part of your daily toolkit.</p>

<p>When you check the readout, your heart skips a beat for a moment. The readings are incredibly high, indicating that either multiple ghosts had been on the premises, or an extremely powerful Thaumaturgic entity was nearby. You hoped it was the former, you could deal with multiple ghosts. If anything, that could actually threaten you was here, you’d have to call in special forces, and that would mean a hell of a lot of paperwork waiting for you back at the station.</p>
<p>You examine the foyer with your detector. The readings seem to be the strongest going towards <a href="page15.html">the bedroom</a> and <a href="page4.html">the living room.</a></p>
