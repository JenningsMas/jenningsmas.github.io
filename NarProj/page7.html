                <p> You exit the mansion as light rain begins to fall. The Mundane investigator from earlier hails you from the street.</p>
                <p>“So, did you-”</p>
                <p>You cut him off. “Ghost did it, but it’s gone. No idea where they went, but I can't track it.” You head to your car without stopping for the other man.</p>
                <p>The investigator sputters for a moment, trying to figure out a question to ask, but you’re already gone by the time he can make up his mind.</p>
                <p>You’ve been a Thaumaturgical Investigator for many, many long years. The first lesson you learned in your line of work was that all crimes, no matter how small, must be investigated, and guilt must be determined.</p>
                <p>The second lesson you learned was that sometimes, it was better to let a smaller crime go if you could use the investigation to get to the bottom of something bigger…</p>
                <p>The ghost that murdered Charles Clockworth was a murderer, yes, and by law they deserved to be punished. But by their actions, they tipped you off to a much worse crime than a simple, mundane murder…</p>
                <p>You’ve never had to investigate crimes across time before, and you know that cracking this case and finding all the criminals who walked free because of Clockworth’s magick would be next to impossible, but that didn’t deter you. As far as you know, you’re the best Thaumaturgical Investigator New York has ever seen.</p>
                <p>If anyone can get to the bottom of this, it’s you.</p>
