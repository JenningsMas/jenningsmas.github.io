            <p>By the time you arrive on the scene, the mundane investigators have already cleared out.
                The moon is high in the sky, bathing the streets of New York, as well as the mansion of the late
                Charles Clockworth, in what on any other night would be considered a serene, peaceful glow.<br>
                Not tonight, though, for a killer remains at large.</p>

            <p>The last of the NYPD’s Mundane Investigation Department’s team greets you as you
                walk up to the ornate double doors at the front of the house, ducking under a line of police tape
                as you enter the scene of the crime.</p>
            <p>“You’re a bit late,” he says, checking his wristwatch. The man is young, clearly a rookie.
                “We found no evidence of the killer in the home. Or the body. Just some blood spatters here and
                there.”</p>
            <p>“Of course you didn’t,” you reply.</p>
            <p>“Hey, you sayin-”</p>
            <p>You cut the officer off before his rant can get started.
                “I’m not insulting your skill. The M.I.D. only hires the best of the best. If you couldn’t
                find anything, a ghost did it.”</p>
            <p>The officer shivers at the suggestion of the paranormal, again, another sign of a rookie.
                Any seasoned vet would have handled a few cases where a ghost was involved, even if they
                weren't a Thaumaturgical Investigator like you.</p>
            <p>“And you think you can, uh...” the officer pauses. “...arrest the ghost, or something?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think I can,” you say as you throw the doors open and walk inside the house. “I
                know I can.”</p>
            <p>Before the officer can reply, the doors slam shut behind you as you <a href="page3.html">enter the scene
                    of the crime...</a></p>
