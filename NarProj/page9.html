               <p>As you lunge down the hall after the ghost, a strange golden light envelops you as runes along the wall blaze to life. A trap! You recognize it as magick, but you can't identify what the spell is or what it might do. That is, until you hear the familiar ticking of clocks…</p>
<p>You almost manage to shout out a swear, but are interrupted as your body lurches, and everything goes black. The last thing you hear is the haunting cackle of the ghost as you fade away…</p>

<p>When you come to, your eyes open to stare at a bright blue sky overhead. You stand, dizzy and disoriented, and you realize with a start that you don’t know where you are…</p>
<p>“Ah, got another  one, did he?” asks a voice behind you.</p>
<p>You whip around, arms raised to fight and see a golden spirit hovering behind you. Like the ghost in the mansion, it looks as if it was drawn into the air rather than being made of anything physical. Clearly, another ghost. A familiar looking ghost… a ghost with a long white beard and bald head…</p>
<p>“Who are you?” you ask, but the answer comes to mind before the ghost speaks.</p>
<p>“Charles Clockworth! The late Charles Clockworth, that is. Master of the seas of time, conqueror of the clock… some other titles that I’m forgetting… ah, it matters not! What matters is that now, we’re both stuck in this situation!”</p>
<p>“What situation?”</p>
<p>“Look around you my new friend,” Clockworth’s ghost gestures. You oblige, and to your utter confusion, you realize you’re definitely not in New York anymore. You’re standing in what appears to be a city, but a lot… older. More colonial…</p>
<p>“Welcome to 1662! Well, by my count anyway. New York City! Lovely place, really. And before you ask, no, I can’t use my magick to send us back” Clockworth’s ghost looks strangely excited for the situation.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“To manipulate spacetime, you need a physical anchor, which without a body I sorely lack. Plus, dying seems to have disconnected me from the greater sum of my magick. I’m afraid all I’m capable of is simple parlor tricks now.” Clockworth’s ghost hangs his head. “But,” he continues as he brightens, which manifests not only as an expression, but a physical glow around his body. “Think of the opportunity we have now! Back in the past from the future, why, my new friend, we could use our knowledge to become kings!”</p>
<p>You take a moment to consider the prospect… if you’re truly stuck in the past with no way out… might as well make the most of it.</p>
<p>“Alright then… so if we want to become ‘kings’, where do we, um, start?”</p>
<p>“We start by getting money, new friend.” Clockworth’s ghost puts his hands on his hips in a triumphant pose. “Lots of it! Between you and me, our mastery of magick will surely help in this regard. People are always ready to part with their coffers for some good quality magick! Now, before you arrived, I got a good lead on a farmer who needs his crops enchanted for growth and yield…”</p>
 
<p>As Clockworth rambles on, you resolve to make the most out of your strange new situation… and as he continues rambling for hours and hours on end, you additionally resolve to find a way to get him to shut up for five minutes.</p>
